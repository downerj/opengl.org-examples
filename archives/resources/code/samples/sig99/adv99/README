makefiles are provided for IRIX, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.
The windows build requires visual c++ or the cygnus cygwin tools.
The visual c++ build uses nmake -f Makefile.win and the
cygwin version uses make -f Makefile.cygwin

Many programs use the texture file loading routines in the util
subdirectory.  These routines read files in the SGI 'rgb' file
format.
